    From here on, let’s get busy working around with databases using SQL! 

--> SQL stands for Structured Query Language
--> SQL is used to perform operations on Relational DBMS.
--> SQL is declarative. Hence, easy to learn.
--> SQL provides multiple clauses (commands) to perform various operations like create, retrieve, update and delete the data.

    Following data types are frequently used in SQL.
