Comparison Operators:
     
     ' = '  ---->   Equal to 
      <>    ---->   Not Equal to 
      <     ---->   Less Than
      <=    ---->   Less Than or Equal to     
      >     ---->   Greater than 
      >=    ---->   Greater than or Equal to 


String Operators:
      
      Like Operator: Used to perform queries on strings.

        Common Patterns :
         
         -- Exact Match                 Wildcard Characters
         -- Starts with                      ---> %
         -- Ends with                        ---> _
         -- Contains
         -- Pattern matching

Logical Operators:

        ----> AND 
                
                SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition_1 AND condition_2;
        
        ----> OR

                SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition_1 OR condition_2 OR condition_3;                

        ----> NOT

                SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition_1;
        

IN and BETWEEN Operators:

    ---> IN Operator

            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column1 IN (val1,val2,val3....);

    ---> BETWEEN Operator

            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column1 BETWEEN Val1 AND Val2;
